In most cases this can be provided\nby adding a type annotation. Sometimes you need to specify a generic type\nparameter manually.\n\nIn the example above, type `Vec` has a type parameter `T`. When calling\n`Vec::new`, barring any other later usage of the variable `x` that allows the\ncompiler to infer what type `T` is, the compiler needs to be told what it is.\n\nThe type can be specified on the variable:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThe type can also be specified in the path of the expression:\n\n```\nlet x = Vec::<i32>::new();\n```\n\nIn cases with more complex types, it is not necessary to annotate the full\ntype. Once the ambiguity is resolved, the compiler can infer the rest:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<_> = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect();\n```\n\nAnother way to provide the compiler with enough information, is to specify the\ngeneric type parameter:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<char>>();\n```\n\nAgain, you need not specify the full type if the compiler can infer it:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<_>>();\n```\n\nApart from a method or function with a generic type parameter, this error can\noccur when a type parameter of a struct or trait cannot be inferred. In that\ncase it is not always possible to use a type annotation, because all candidates\nhave the same return type. For instance:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nstruct Foo<T> {\n    num: T,\n}\n\nimpl<T> Foo<T> {\n    fn bar() -> i32 {\n        0\n    }\n\n    fn baz() {\n        let number = Foo::bar();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will fail because the compiler does not know which instance of `Foo` to\ncall `bar` on.

Example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we implement the trait on the i32 type\nimpl Foo for i32 {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar(); // we can now use this method since i32 implements the\n               // Foo trait\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    some_func(5i32); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr in a generic context, an erroneous code example would look like:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\nfn some_func<T>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo); // error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not\n                           //        implemented for the type `T`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // We now call the method with the i32 type,\n    // which *does* implement the Debug trait.\n    some_func(5i32);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the error here is in the definition of the generic function. Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function. It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func<T: fmt::Debug>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"cli/ssh/src/main.rs","byte_start":2916,"byte_end":2955,"line_start":102,"line_end":102,"column_start":70,"column_end":109,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"async fn connect_ssh(args: &Args, username: &str, hostname: &str) -> Result<client::Handle<client::Session>> {","highlight_start":70,"highlight_end":109}],"label":"the trait `russh::client::Handler` is not implemented for `russh::client::Session`","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":{"span":{"file_name":"cli/ssh/src/main.rs","byte_start":2916,"byte_end":2955,"line_start":102,"line_end":102,"column_start":70,"column_end":109,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"async fn connect_ssh(args: &Args, username: &str, hostname: &str) -> Result<client::Handle<client::Session>> {","highlight_start":70,"highlight_end":109}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},"macro_decl_name":"desugaring of `async` block or function","def_site_span":{"file_name":"cli/ssh/src/main.rs","byte_start":0,"byte_end":0,"line_start":1,"line_end":1,"column_start":1,"column_end":1,"is_primary":false,"text":[],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}}}],"children":[{"message":"required by a bound in `russh::client::Handle`","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[{"file_name":"/root/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/russh-0.40.2/src/client/mod.rs","byte_start":6791,"byte_end":6798,"line_start":235,"line_end":235,"column_start":22,"column_end":29,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"pub struct Handle<H: Handler> {","highlight_start":22,"highlight_end":29}],"label":"required by this bound in `Handle`","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0277]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: the trait bound `russh::client::Session: russh::client::Handler` is not satisfied\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0mcli/ssh/src/main.rs:102:70\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m102\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m async fn connect_ssh(args: &Args, username: &str, hostname: &str) -> Result<client::Handle<client::Session>> {\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                                                      \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91mthe trait `russh::client::Handler` is not implemented for `russh::client::Session`\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[92mnote\u001b[0m: required by a bound in `russh::client::Handle`\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0m/root/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/russh-0.40.2/src/client/mod.rs:235:22\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m235\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m pub struct Handle<H: Handler> {\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                      \u001b[1m\u001b[92m^^^^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[92mrequired by this bound in `Handle`\u001b[0m\n\n"}
